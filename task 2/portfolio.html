            <image class="personal_img" src="interests.png">
            <p>I am an engineering student who's pursuing her undergraduate bachelor's degree in computer science.
                I am a creative individual who thrives in environments that require creative or artistic solutions.
                Despite being an introvert, I can work well in groups or teams. My major flaw would be procrastination,
                i would wait until the very end to finish the work given, and thus,  my major strength is that I work 
                well with deadlines without compromising the quality of work.</p>

            <div class="b">
            <p>I have an assortment of hobbies, most of which involve some creativity in one way or another. One of my major hobbies that heavily relies on my creativity is art, specifically drawing, I love to draw and doodle, and seeing an end product after all that time and effort is very gratifying. One of the other main hobbies I indulge in is reading It is one of my most effective ways to decompress, I read from a variety of mediums ranging from webcomics to classic literature. the other hobby I have during times when I'm not in the head space to read or think is crocheting it is an easy way to get myself to turn my brain off and relax and by the end of it I'll get myself a new scarf!! </p>

            <p>My Interests lie in the realm of Artificial Intelligence, So concepts of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep Learning fascinates me. Web development is a keen interest of mine as well, it is a field that thrives on creativity to garner the attention and interest of customers/users. My fascination with AI may have begun as a child who watched sci-fi films, but over the years I am beginning to truly understand its potential and its astronomical benefits to humanity as a whole.  </p>
